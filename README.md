# 🛡️ InternGuard AI

### *AI-Powered Internship Scam Detection & Verification Platform*

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Internship scams are rising rapidly, targeting students through:

* Fake offer letters
* Phishing internship portals
* Fraudulent recruiters
* Malware-hosting internship links
* Data-harvesting forms

Most platforms are generic fraud checkers.
None specialize in **internship-specific scam intelligence** with explainable AI + security scanning.

## 💡 The InternGuard AI Solution

InternGuard AI is a specialized cybersecurity platform that:

* 🔍 Verifies internship offers & URLs
* 🧠 Uses NLP-based scam detection
* 🛡️ Implements OWASP-inspired security checks
* 🌐 Deploys **Reputation Shield** for community validation
* 🤖 Integrates AI-powered career safety guidance

It doesn’t just say “scam.”

It shows *why*.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

1. Student uploads an offer letter or pastes internship URL
2. System:

   * Extracts content
   * Performs NLP scam similarity analysis
   * Runs OWASP-inspired vulnerability checks
   * Checks Reputation Shield reports
3. Output:

   * Risk Score
   * Scam Probability %

## 🏆 Why InternGuard AI Stands Out

* Niche-focused internship scam detection
* Combines ML + Cybersecurity
* Explainable AI outputs
* Community-powered fraud intelligence
* OWASP-based vulnerability scanning
* Fully deployable architecture

It’s not just a checker.

It’s a digital internship firewall.
